## 🚀 Workshop Flow

### 1️⃣ Introduction (10 min)
Explain in simple terms:
- “AI helps computers recognize things”
- “Face recognition compares faces, it does not *think*”
- Privacy reminder: faces stay on the device

💬 Suggested sentence:
> “Today, we will teach a computer to recognize our face, like in a game.”

---

### 2️⃣ Setup (15 min)
- Launch Face Quest in the browser
- Flash the micro:bit with the provided code
- Connect the micro:bit via Bluetooth

Check:
- micro:bit displays `BLE`
- Browser shows “Connected”

---

### 3️⃣ Face Enrollment (10 min)
Students:
- Click **Enroll Face**
- Look at the camera multiple times

Explain:
- “The computer is learning patterns”
- “More samples = better results”

Celebrate:
- 🎉 micro:bit shows happy animation
- ⭐ Points / Stars earned

---

### 4️⃣ Recognition Tests (15 min)
Try different cases:
- Same student → MATCH
- Different student → NO
- Glasses / mask / light changes

Discuss:
- Why results change
- Importance of lighting and angles

---

### 5️⃣ Challenges & Exploration (15–30 min)

Ideas:
- Can you trick the system?
- What happens in the dark?
- Add an LED or buzzer to P0
- Rename XP to Stars
- Create a “Face Quest Champion”

---

## 🧩 Discussion Questions

- Is face recognition always correct?
- Where is it used in real life?
- Is it safe? What about privacy?
- Should AI always be trusted?

Encourage critical thinking 💡

---

## ⚠️ Safety & Ethics Notes

- Do NOT store faces online
- Use only with consent
- Explain that AI can make mistakes
- Avoid real surveillance scenarios

---

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting (Quick)

| Problem | Solution |
|------|---------|
| Bluetooth not found | Use Chrome / Edge |
| micro:bit not connecting | Refresh page, reconnect |
| Face not recognized | Improve lighting |
| UNKNOWN_CMD | Check sent command |

---

## 🏁 Learning Outcomes

By the end of the workshop, students can:
- Explain what face recognition is
- Understand basic AI limitations
- Use Bluetooth to control hardware
- Connect software with real-world actions

---

## 🎉 Conclusion

**Face Quest** turns complex concepts like AI and Bluetooth into a **playful, understandable experience**, helping students learn by **doing, testing, and questioning**.

✨ *Learning AI should feel like a game — and Face Quest makes it one.*
